  - "ah! the Toymaker\u2019s creation! or is it you there Toymaker? I never understood
    how your technology works\u2026"
  - "Anyway, we are all in your depth for coming here today. if not for your we might
    have fallen to the vortex below\u2026 "
  - but what is it that you came for? Would you like to hear about the long-forgotten
    past before the world was shattered?
  - ha! of course, you would want to!

    Invented The Howlin Reactor. '

    supervision, or if it fell in the wrong hands. "
  - the legend says that it is so powerful, that one could hear as power howls from
    within, raging to be unleashed to its true potential.
  - 'With this creation, The First Flying City of "Frostmoon" was created. years
    past and The city created thousands of flying cities, such as our little town. '

    the flying cities and towns afloat without the fear of the Gravitational Holes.
  - The tale is that The Grand Inventor created a Secret hidden flying Isle, The
    Clockwork Isles, where he hid the Last known existing Reactor before Frostmoon
    vanished.
  - 'I believe that the Nomads that arrived in our town have indeed found those Isles,
    I suggest you talk to them, try to learn what they have to say before you venture
    out. '
  - farewell Toymaker, stay safe, and come back soon!
