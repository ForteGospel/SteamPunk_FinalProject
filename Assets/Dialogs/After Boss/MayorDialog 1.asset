  - huh, so is that the machine you spoke of, Toymaker?
  - I must admit it looks... Impressive, your best creation yet indeed
  - We all, well, most, I mean Some of us believe in you, no offense, of course,
    it's just with your age and day, we have our doubts, but since you have volunteered,
    I guess you are our best, and only chance of claiming the Isle treasures.
  - but you have proven yourself capable today to face on danger
  - 'I only hope it is enough to take on the dangers of Isles that the Nomads spoke
    of... '
  - "A single lightning from a tower struck the ship down they say, huh can\u2019t
    imagine what other surprises are hidden there."
