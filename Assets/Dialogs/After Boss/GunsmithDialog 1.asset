  - "The mayor told me you will be coming here, didn\u2019t know what to expect from
    our old Toymaker\u2026"
  - "I\u2019m dearly sorry, toymaker, but I can not help you, my smith is in ruin,,
    and I can not provide your robot with a firearm, but you may keep the gun."
  - Maybe someday in the future, I could craft you something more, until then, I
    bid you farewell and good luck on your journey.
